# Hey, I'm Chris 

16 year old developer from Texas, USA. I picked up coding at 9, and what started as messing around with Python turned into 7 years of going deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. Somewhere along the way I picked up 11 languages and developed a slight obsession with making things fast, efficient, and way more complicated than they need to be.

I like projects that are actually interesting, reverse engineering stuff, exploiting math patterns in weird places, and building tools that probably shouldn't exist but do anyway.

## What I Work With

**Languages**

```
Python  C++  Java  JavaScript  TypeScript  Lua / Luau  
Rust  Go  C#  Bash  SQL  C
```

**Databases**

PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, and a little Redis when I'm feeling fancy

**Tools & Other Stuff**

Git, Linux, Docker, Fabric (Minecraft modding API), various packet analysis tools, etc

## What I Actually Build

- **Minecraft mods** using Fabric, everything from motion blur and hit registration fixes to RNG crackers, villager trade automation, and structure seed finders
- **Reverse engineering tools** including packet proxies and game memory analysis stuff
- **Math heavy projects** like raymarching engines, 3D renderers, and numerical methods implementations
- **Discord plugins** via Vencord
- Random scripts that solve specific problems I have and probably nobody else does

## A Bit More About Me

- 4.0 GPA, yeah I do both
- 143 IQ
- Bilingual (English + Spanish)
- Drawn to anything that combines programming with interesting math
- Currently exploring anesthesiology as a possible career path cause it pays a lot, lol.

## What I'm Into Right Now

Grinding through more low level systems stuff, optimizing things that are already pretty fast, locked in on school and extracurriculars.
